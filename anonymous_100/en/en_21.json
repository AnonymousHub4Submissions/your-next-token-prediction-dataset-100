            "response": "Of course, I would first travel around the world with my friends. Then I would open a cozy little shop, chat with friends every day, go hiking, play ball, etc."

            "message": "Very inspiring plan! Now, let's analyze this logically: if you had to allocate that 100 million realistically, how would you divide it among travel expenses, setting up your shop, daily living costs, and savings? What proportions make the most practical sense to you?",
            "response": "Travel expenses should only take up about 10%. Opening and maintaining the shop should take up about 30%. The remaining 10% can be used to pursue other interests. The rest can be saved for later use."

Is it a clear goal you’re aiming for, like opening that cozy shop and living that joyful life, or is it more about the feelings and values that inspire you every day? What’s the true heart behind your vision?",
            "response": "Humans are social animals. So, being able to communicate with different people every day is like living another person's life. A person's life is limited, but we can experience different life experiences through chatting."

I'm not one to be overly particular, but surely we all desire a certain standard when it comes to preserving fresh ingredients and our daily meals, do we not? How might we better balance this shared space to maintain such quality for everyone, including ourselves?",
            "response": "That's a really good question. I think the best approach is to zone the space based on the number of people, so that no one interferes with the other and avoids conflicts. If someone needs someone else's space temporarily, they can certainly request it."

            "message": "Haha, friend, fridge space is definitely a team effort and requires some give and take! What if we rearranged the layout a bit to make things more fair and easy to access for everyone? How would you like to see the fridge zones organized so it works best for you and the rest of the crew? Let's make it awesome together!",
            "response": "Perhaps we could divide the space by food type? But that could easily lead to conflicts, as everyone's eating habits are different. So allocating space based on space size might be the best way to minimize conflicts. Of course, what about buying a new refrigerator?"

Donatello’s ready to tackle all the techie stuff to make sure it’s doable, and Michelangelo's got the eye for the artsy and awesome designs! Will you jump in with your creative ideas to help us dream up the ultimate hangout space? Come on, friend, spill your wildest and coolest ideas—let’s make this room truly legendary! Haha!",
            "response": "For a party or something, I think mahjong is a must. Oh, it seems you're not very good at it, but that's okay, you'll definitely love it. Poker is also a good option. Of course, we also need to develop a penalty game."

            "message": "Your game ideas definitely bring great energy to the room. Logically speaking, to bring all this to life, we need to carefully consider space utilization, material costs, and how easy it will be to maintain everything over time. From your perspective, do you think we should prioritize practical functionality or focus more on the design aesthetics to make the space feel truly inviting?",
            "response": "Isn't this a party? No need to overthink it. Just prepare food and entertainment and enjoy the time. As for the rest, you can clean up after you wake up."

So, when you’re bringing these ideas to life, would you embrace any hardships to achieve perfect results, or would you lean toward an easier compromise to keep things smooth?",
            "response": "This is a difficult decision. If it's not a major undertaking, then of course you should give it a try. Regardless of the outcome, you must pursue your goal. However, if failure carries significant consequences, I suggest you consider it carefully."

I must confess, last night’s creative activity was quite an impressive expression of energy, yet I found it rather... difficult to focus on my own artwork amidst the continuous noise. I'm not being picky, but I had hoped for a bit more mutual respect when it comes to maintaining a conducive environment for creation. Perhaps my expectations were simply too high for a shared space such as this?",
            "response": "While it's certainly cool to be around a group of like-minded people creating together, it's important to acknowledge that everyone's goals and mental states are different and constantly evolving. Perhaps creating is better suited to a private space of one's own, or a more specialized space where people with similar goals gather."

            "speaker": "Raffaello",
            "message": "Oh... I must add, it took me nearly an hour to tidy up the 'creative remnants' left in the shared area afterward. I'm not being overly fastidious, but if I recall correctly, we all agreed in the lease to uphold a certain standard of cleanliness and respect for our living environment. I wonder... do you think this standard remains fair and achievable for all of us?",
            "response": "I believe that shared spaces must clearly define what the expected state of the space is, and who is responsible for cleaning it each day. This is crucial, as everyone is inherently selfish. No one wants to spend too much. Therefore, specific rules must be established; otherwise, any other contract will be useless."

            "speaker": "Donatello",
            "message": "Indeed, we need to balance creative freedom with the quality of our living environment. Logically speaking, a schedule that designates specific hours for active creative work and separate quiet periods for rest or focused reflection might help maintain this balance. From your perspective, what kind of schedule seems most reasonable and fair to encourage both productive creativity and peaceful coexistence here?",
            "response": "Generally speaking, you should keep quiet at night. Avoid making noise during the weekdays, and you can make your own arrangements on weekday evenings and weekends. Of course, in principle, you should avoid causing excessive trouble to others at all times."

We can chat, tweak our shared space rules, and make sure everyone’s voice is heard to keep our ShareHouse awesome and harmonious! What do you think? Would you join the fun?",
            "response": "This is certainly a good idea, but some people might think it's a waste of time. So while it might work well initially, some people might become less willing to work it out. And since everyone has different perspectives, it's hard to always reach consensus."

            "message": "Oh... considering the suggestion to perhaps invest in a new refrigerator to accommodate our needs better, I find myself wondering—I'm not being picky, but wouldn't it be more prudent to first improve our organizational systems for shared spaces? After all, new purchases require both space and upkeep. Might it be wiser to prioritize refinement of our current arrangements before adding more items? I suppose balancing investment and functionality is crucial, wouldn’t you agree?",
            "response": "No, after buying a new refrigerator, you definitely have to sell the old one. Otherwise, it'll take up the already limited space. That's for sure, right? No one wants to have two refrigerators and cause trouble, right? I'm curious why you brought this up all of a sudden."

It could be a fantastic way to bring everyone together, spark fresh energy, and build a stronger community vibe here! What do you think—would you be excited to lead such a fun tradition and help turn our house into a hub of laughter and connection?",
            "response": "Of course, if we still have to work all the time when we get together, everyone's mood will be very depressed. When we get together, we must play some games together. Having a relaxing time can help us better devote ourselves to work and creation in the rest of the time."

Logically speaking, how do you propose we organize our schedule to ensure lively group activities don’t encroach on the quiet time necessary for focused work and relaxation? What specific time allocations or rules might help maintain this balance effectively?",
            "response": "Because it is a group activity, we must discuss each activity together and find the right time and game to arrange the activity. Therefore, it is best to choose a time when everyone is free, such as weekends."
