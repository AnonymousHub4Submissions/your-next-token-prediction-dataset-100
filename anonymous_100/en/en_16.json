However, logically speaking, have you considered budgeting for daily consumption within your travel expenses? It's important to factor in living costs to maintain a comfortable, sustainable lifestyle during your trips. Now, returning to the initial question—could you specify approximate amounts or percentages you’d set for consumption versus investment within your savings? This will help us refine a practical plan.",

Also, in your dream room, do you lean more toward prioritizing practicality and function, or do you want design and aesthetics to take the lead?",
