            "response": "I don't need to invest, I should be able to live on 100 million without needing to increase it any further. I'll think about it if I run out of money, but for now I'll use it all to travel."

I'm not being picky, but surely we all wish to maintain a certain quality of life here, including having room for fresh ingredients and a bit of order—do you think that’s something we might consider together?",

To optimize the day, I suggest allocating mornings for focused, potentially noisy or collaborative tasks when energy and alertness peak. Afternoons could balance creative solo work and social interactions, allowing flexibility. Evening times should be reserved for quieter, less disruptive activities to maintain harmony. This structure maximizes productivity while respecting shared living dynamics. What specific creative or technical tasks do you see fitting best into each period? Let's map that out for an efficient, respectful routine.",
