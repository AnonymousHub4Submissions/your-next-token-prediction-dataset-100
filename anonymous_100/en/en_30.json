            "response": "I will assign 50 million to investment, and use the rest of that on consumption."

Is it a clear goal you’re chasing with strong intention, or more of a deep value or feeling that drives you forward? Art, life, and dreams all have that special spark!",

I’m not being picky, but perhaps we all value having room for fresh ingredients—that surely matters to our daily living comfort, does it not?",

Maybe we can designate specific zones or change shelf order for better fit. What’s your dream plan for organizing the fridge to make it awesome and fair for everyone?",

Logically speaking, to make the music club room functional, we need to carefully consider space utilization, material costs, and how easy it will be to maintain. For you, which matters more: practical functionality or the overall design and vibe of the room?",

That’s a fair approach, especially in creative projects. However, to balance your enthusiasm for design with practical constraints, we should outline clear design goals while keeping an eye on space and materials. Now, returning to my original point—how would you rank the importance of practical function versus aesthetic appeal in daily use? This will help us frame the technical plan for the music club room effectively.",

I intended to immerse myself in finishing my artwork, yet the continuous noise made concentration rather elusive. I’m not being picky, but I thought we all valued a basic level of mutual respect in shared spaces. Perhaps my expectations were too high?",
