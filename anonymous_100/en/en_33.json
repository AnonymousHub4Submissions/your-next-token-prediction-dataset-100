            "response": "First of all, i would save money 50% of 100 million.\nthen, I would invest 1% to 5% of all.\nAnd around 20%, I'd like to use for me. rest of money, perhaps i have to spend for my normal life."

Or is it more about the feelings and values, like the joy of sharing moments with your family and lover? Art and dreams are both fueled by heart and vision—how about yours?",
            "response": "thank you for making me think about my trip deeply.\nso far, I' thinking about second one which you suggested me.\nBecause, if I visit all famous place, it'll be so hectic and i won't be able to enjoy enough.\nInstead, I wanna spend  wonderful n unforgettable time with my family n lover to make special memories.

I'm not being picky, but the abundance of packaged foods seems to take up quite a bit of room—space that fresh ingredients, perhaps more aligned with a certain quality of life, could better utilize. I suppose we all hope to maintain that same standard of living here, don't we? What are your thoughts on managing our fridge space to preserve a comfortable environment for everyone?",
            "response": "Once we should hold a meeting to discuss shared space.\nI would say some people might have expired things and extra things and so on...\nand we should decide about spice. because everyone can use spice, so we shouldn't buy spice for each person."

How about we shake things up and try rearranging the fridge layout to fit everyone’s fresh and packaged goodies better? What’s your dream setup for the fridge space? Any clever ideas to make it awesome and fair for all of us?",
            "response": "for me, I would prepare for containers like box one by one for each person.\nthen, I let them keep food inside that one. if we do properly, we will not be in trouble to filled with food or something in refrigerator."

Wanna jump in and share your coolest ideas on how we can make our room the ultimate cozy, creative paradise? Come on, friend, dream big with me!",
            "response": "From my point of view,  your rooms look very simple. I have several suggestions. First, you should decide the motif of room which is your desire. if I were you, after i would decide theme, i would collect furniture, change wallpaper like that. then, I try to approach that room which i wanna achieve!!\nfor example, I wanna make room related to sky. and i would change my furniture's color, like sky blue. and i apply wallpaper which cloud and sky are designed...is my suggestion good...?"

I’m not being picky, but I had hoped for at least a modicum of mutual respect that would allow us all some quiet. Perhaps my expectations were too high... do you think it’s too much to ask for a shared space where creativity and consideration coexist gracefully?",
            "response": "For me, you're right. some people prefer stay at the party which many people are. but others don't like.\ni also prefer stay silently. so we should keep balance between creativoty and consideration"

Perhaps my expectations are too high, but finding that equilibrium seems essential, don’t you think?",
