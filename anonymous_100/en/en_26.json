Now, let's analyze this realistically: if you had that full 100 million, how would you divide it between something like investing for the future, enjoying some immediate spending, and maybe putting some aside as savings? What proportions make the most sense to you?",
            "response": "I will use the half of the money for investing, and the rest will be saved for helping."

            "message": "Let's analyze this. You plan to invest 50 million and save the remaining 50 million for helping others. That indicates no immediate personal consumption. Logically speaking, it's a solid approach if your priority is future growth and social support. However, have you considered allocating a portion for your own living expenses or short-term enjoyment? A balanced ratio often includes some spending to maintain quality of life. Let’s revisit this: how would you adjust your plan if you factored in consumption alongside investment and savings?",
            "response": "Hmm, then I will use 10% of money for enjoying. Primally, I thought using money for enjoying means investing for myself."

Is it a clear goal you’re aiming for, like a masterpiece waiting to be carved, or is it more about the emotions and values that light up your heart? Art is all about that spark inside!",

I’m not being picky, but perhaps fresh ingredients deserving of more room would better serve our lifestyles. After all, I believe we all value a balanced and pleasant living environment, don’t you agree?",
            "response": "I agree with you. To share this house fairly, we need some rules not to offend other members, but this rule must be too strict to suppress us."

How about this—we rearrange the layout a bit so everyone gets a fair slice of the cool storage pie! What’s your dream plan for organizing the fridge? Any awesome ideas on how we can share the space better? Let’s make it fun and fair for all of us!",
            "response": "As a fair and simple suggestion, we should separate fridge rooms equally. And if someone thinks he/she needs more space, and another thinks he/she do not need, then they have a discussion and rearrange their space."

Donatello will make sure our ideas are technically possible, while Michelangelo will sprinkle artistic magic all over the design! Wanna jump in and share your wildest, most creative ideas on how our dream room should look and feel? Let’s make it awesome together!",

From a technical standpoint, we need to consider space utilization, material costs, and ease of maintenance for this black-and-white theme. In your vision, would you prioritize the practicality of the room’s function or the design aesthetics more?",
            "response": "I primally think the room's function. Even though we are now making our dream room, we must use the room after completion, so we should pay attention to the usefulness."

If reaching perfection means facing some tough hardships along the way, would you stand firm and embrace the struggle, or would you prefer to take an easier path with some compromises?",

Would you say such lively expressions align well with maintaining a shared environment conducive to everyone’s creative process?",

I wonder... what are your thoughts on how we might better uphold these standards together?",

That way, we all get what we need without any fridge drama! What do you think—ready to make our kitchen even more awesome together?",
            "response": "As I said on the 2nd day, separating equally is one of the easiest solutions. And I think other methods will be more effective after this rule is tried and we understand how we consume the space in fridge."

If we must choose between ease of maintenance and bold design elements, how might we prioritize? I’m not being picky, but I do wonder if the function should gently take precedence over aesthetics, especially if we aim for lasting harmony in our shared space. Would you agree that some struggles in upkeep are acceptable if the design truly inspires, or should we lean towards simplicity to ensure tranquility?",
            "response": "I think the design of the room will not be prioritized the usefulness of the room. Our room is not the thing we discard once we used, so we must think whether we can use the room freely in the long run."
