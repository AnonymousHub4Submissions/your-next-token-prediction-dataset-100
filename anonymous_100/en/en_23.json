            "message": "Good question. Logically speaking, the 100 million I referred to is in yen, as it's a common large-sum reference in this context. Now that we've clarified the currency, let's analyze your plan with that in mind. How would you distribute the 100 million yen between investment, travel expenses, and savings? A clear ratio helps in creating a practical and efficient strategy.",

I’m not being picky, but the many packaged foods seem to take up room that could better accommodate fresh ingredients. We all appreciate a certain quality of life here, don’t we? How do you feel about maintaining a harmonious balance in our shared spaces to support that?",
            "response": "We can attach a sticky note on the refrigerator door and write the list of the stuff & owner's name & expiry date!"

How about we shake things up a bit and rearrange the layout inside? Maybe group fresh veggies here, packaged foods there—something that feels fair to everyone! What’s your dream fridge makeover plan? Share your awesome ideas!",
            "response": "I'll keep fresh veggies and meats in the lower part (colder part because it's close to fridge section) and side dishes I usually have will be the upper & middle part because my eyes can see them easily."

Donatello will tackle the technical magic to make it totally doable, and Michelangelo will splash in the artistic vibes to make it stunning! Want to jump in and share your wildest, most awesome ideas to make our dream room rock? Come on, friend, let’s make this space legendary together! Haha!",

Logically speaking, do you think we should prioritize practical setup and durability, or emphasize sleek design and aesthetics? What balance seems most reasonable to you?",

So, in building our dream room, would you be ready to push through some tough challenges and aim for perfection, or would you lean toward an easier path with some compromises to keep things smooth?",
            "response": "I'll push through some touch challenges-if it appears- and aim for perfection. Because, once you setting something up, it last quite long and there will be less opportunity to fix the issues. So I prefer pursuing perfection rather than doing mediocre."

I found myself unable to focus on finishing my artwork amidst the continuous noise. I am not being picky, but I had hoped for a certain mutual respect in shared spaces.

I am not being picky, but we did agree when signing the lease to maintain a certain standard of quality within the house. Do you think this expectation is... reasonable and something we can all commit to going forward?",
            "response": "Oh I see. I think maintaining the quality within the house is good. But if you make some noises due to that reason, you might be able to discuss it with other mates beforehand."
