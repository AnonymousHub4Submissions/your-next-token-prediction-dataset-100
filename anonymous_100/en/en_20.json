            "response": "About 70% on treasure bonds or something and the rest is spending money, after that I would focus on maintaining the monthly expenses withing the passive income limit."

I'm not being picky, but perhaps preserving enough space for fresh ingredients could help us all maintain the kind of quality in daily living we're striving for... Would you agree this balance is important for our shared comfort?",

How about we shake things up by rearranging the layout to make sure fresh ingredients and packaged foods both get their fair share? What’s your dream plan for organizing our chilly treasure chest? Let’s hear your awesome ideas!",
            "response": "We can just divide the fridge in sections for each of us, organize to buy a new one that is bigger, or just limit the amount of packaged food per person."

Donatello will dive into the technical stuff to make sure our ideas can really work, and Michelangelo will lead the artistic vibe to make the space truly awesome! So, what wild, fun, or cozy ideas do you have for our dream room? Come on, share your coolest visions—let’s create magic together! Haha!",

In this case, do you think we should prioritize practical function—like efficient use of space and durability—or focus more on design aesthetics to make the room visually appealing?",
            "response": "Well, if it's an entertainment room the practicality of it won't matter anyways. Let's just do our own thing."

When it comes to creating our dream space, would you be ready to push through challenges and keep striving for that perfect vibe, or would you rather take an easier route and settle for something simpler?",

I’m not being picky, but I imagined we all valued a certain mutual respect in shared spaces. Perhaps, then, my expectations were too high?",

I’m not being overly fastidious, but we did agree in our lease to uphold the quality and tidiness of the house. Do you think this standard is... reasonable to maintain for the sake of all our comforts?",
            "response": "The noise is inevitable, but leaving littering is a little too far,  we should run a trial and find the perpetrator.\n\nThat's a joke btw, well we just need to make sure the place is not a mess, so maybe a cleaning schedule where each person pick up the slack?"

To address both noise and tidiness concerns, I propose establishing a clear schedule that designates specific hours for more active, possibly noisy work, and quiet hours for focused solitude. Alongside this, a rotating cleaning schedule could ensure shared responsibility for upkeep. Logically speaking, what structure for activity and quiet hours do you think would be most reasonable and fair for everyone involved?",
