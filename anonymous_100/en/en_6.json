            "response": "I guess I will save about 45% and invest about 40% of it - and use the other 15% to spend on traveling - I feel like 15 million is still a lot of money to spend on traveling."

I can feel the passion behind your plan—now I’m curious, what drives this dream more for you: is it a clear goal you’re aiming to achieve, or is it the excitement and values behind experiencing the world that fuel your journey? Art, life, dreams—they all have their own heartbeat! What’s yours?",
            "response": "Well, it's not exactly a clear goal I am trying to achieve. It actually something thats away from what I want to achieve in life talking work wise. I guess its the excitement to meet new cultures, food, and art around the world, because I myself, though not professional, am a musician. "

I’m not being picky, but don’t you think it’s important for all of us—yourself included—to have enough room to store fresh ingredients properly? Perhaps we could consider how best to balance our needs for convenience and quality living... What are your thoughts on ensuring this delicate harmony?",
            "response": "Yeah, I think we gotta reduce the amount of packaged foods so we can fit more fresh ingredients properly. But I do think using packaged food is alright sometimes because we don't always have the time to cook ourselves healthy meals and the only thing we can do is not starve ourselves. "

            "message": "Haha, friend, you’re so right—fridge space definitely calls for some mutual concession! How about we rearrange the layout to make sure everyone’s fresh ingredients get their own cozy corner without throwing out the convenience of packaged foods? What’s your dream plan for organizing our chilly kingdom? Any awesome ideas on how we can balance it all?",
            "response": "Maybe we could decide to use 2/3 of the fridge for fresh foods and 1/3 for packaged meals. Also, we could consider cooking meal preps for the week on weekends when we are not as busy so that we can further reduce the amount of packaged food to like about 1/4 or 1/5 of the fridge.

Donatello will dive into all the technical stuff—like what’s actually doable—and Michelangelo will lead the artistic vibe to make our space pop with creativity! Wanna jump in with your own wild ideas for how our dream room should look and work? Come on, let’s make this place legendary together! Haha!",
            "response": "I don't know if its doable, but I think having hammocks in the room would make it really cozy and nice! I also think having more plants indoors will enlighten and refreshen our room!"

Next, let’s analyze the technical side: we need to consider space utilization to avoid clutter, material costs to stay within budget, and maintenance to keep everything safe and clean. From your perspective, do you prioritize practicality and function, or are you more focused on design and aesthetics in this dream room?",
            "response": "Well I think I would prioritise practicality and function - because it would be sad if the furniture is too fragile and breaks easily. I believe we can still explore the creative side of furniture to a certain extent even if we prioritise the function. "

            "response": "If it were a home that I would live tlil the end of life, I guess I will endure the hardships and challenges to reach absolute perfection. If not, I might lean towards an easier compromise because I may not have all the time to aspire perfection. "

I must confess, I found it quite challenging to focus on my own artwork amidst the ongoing noise. I'm not being picky, but I had hoped for a certain level of mutual respect in our shared space—perhaps my expectations were too high? Do you think we might find a balance that allows both lively expression and peaceful concentration?",
            "response": "Sorry if we were bothering yesterday  - and yes, I think we should come up with a rule so we can mutually respect each other. I think we should first make an environment where its safe for everyone to address any uncomfortable situations so that we could improve on that in the future. Also we could make same fixed hours during the day where we each do what we want to do individually so that we won't bother each other. How does that sound to you?"

I'm not being picky, but we did agree upon signing the lease to maintain a certain quality of the house environment. Do you think it's... appropriate for us to keep this standard consistently?",
            "response": "Well, yes, because clean common space benefits everyone living in here. However, I do think you being the one to clean up after us is not fair at all, so we should remind ourselves to clean up after our own mess so it wouldn't be extra burden for a person. I am sincerely sorry for making you do that yesterday. "

To support this, I propose we set a clear schedule dividing active creative hours from quiet, restorative times. From a practical point of view, what time blocks for activity and quiet hours do you think would be most reasonable and effective for all of us to respect both productivity and peacefulness?",
            "response": "Its totally my personal opinion - but I do like it when we eat meals together so maybe times between lunch and dinner would be a nice time? I thought after dinner would be fine as well, but I figured it won't always work if we wanted to have some party like the first day I came here. "

I'm not being picky, but perhaps striking that balance is more delicate than it seems… What are your thoughts on this?",
            "response": "Well...if we have limited space in our flat, I guess  I'd prefer furniture that is more multifunctional and space saving. That's life. However though, I think we could try to blast our creativity in other parts like decorations on the walls where we don't need to think about practicality. "

Could this rhythm help us all find that perfect flow between a vibrant buzz and soothing focus?",
            "response": "I think that is a great idea, because even if we like each other and have fun spending time together, it is also important that we get some time to ourselves in privacy so that we can think deeply and focus on personal needs. "

            "response": "Maybe I would get a comfortable big sofa for the five us to share in the living room so we could have some quality time together there  - perhaps watch a movie together or just drink and talk. Shared hammock was a great idea but I figured we won't be able to use it together. "
