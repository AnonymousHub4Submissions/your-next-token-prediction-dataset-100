            "response": "Hmm, I think I’d love to get a grand piano… and of course a soundproof room so I can play it as much as I want without holding back~"

            "speaker": "Donatello",
            "message": "Very interesting idea. Next, let's consider it realistically: if you were to allocate that 100 million, how would you divide it among investment, consumption, and savings? What proportions seem most logical to you?",
            "response": "Well, the consumption part would be the piano and the soundproof room, and I think that could be covered with about half of it~ As for the rest, maybe around 30% for investments and 20% for savings feels just right to me!"

            "message": "Wow, your plan sounds so well thought out and passionate—truly inspiring! Tell me, what drives your dream of having that grand piano and soundproof room? Is it more about hitting a clear goal, like mastering your music, or is it all about the deep emotions and values that music stirs inside you? Art is all about that spark!",
            "response": "Right now, it’s not really about trying to master music—it’s more about just playing for the pure joy of it. So I guess it’s simply following wherever my heart wants to go!"

I'm not being picky, but I imagine we all value having enough space for fresh ingredients and preserving a certain standard of living, don't we? How do you feel about finding a balance that suits everyone’s needs?",
            "response": "Yeah, totally—fresh stuff really needs to go straight into the fridge. Hmm, maybe the packaged foods that don’t really need refrigeration could be kept outside instead? That might make things feel a lot more comfortable for everyone."

            "speaker": "DaVinci",
            "message": "Haha, friend, you’re right—sharing fridge space definitely calls for some give and take! How about we try rearranging the whole layout a bit to make it even more comfortable for everyone? What’s your dream fridge reorganization plan? Tell me all your awesome ideas!",
            "response": "Reorganizing sounds great! Just like in this house, maybe the fridge should have both personal space and shared space. A spot where you can put things without worry, and another we all use together when needed—it feels like that would keep problems from popping up, right?"

Donatello’s gonna dive into all the technical stuff to make it work, and Michelangelo will bring the artistic magic to make it look stunning! Will you jump in with your creative sparks? What wild and wonderful ideas do you have to turn a room into our ultimate dream space? Tell me everything, friend!",
            "response": "Oooh, I love the sound of a “dream room”! Let’s see… for me, since I’m really into the arts, I’d be so happy with a grand piano, a drawing tablet, and a space that just looks beautiful enough to spark creativity whenever I glance around."
        },

            "speaker": "Donatello",
            "message": "Very exciting ideas so far! Now, let’s analyze this room concept realistically: we need to optimize space utilization, keep material costs manageable, and think about ease of maintenance. In your vision, do you lean more toward practicality to ensure function and durability, or do you prioritize design aesthetics to fuel creativity and atmosphere?",
            "response": "Hmm, that’s a tough question… I do get how important practicality is, especially with cost and all that. So I’d like to keep the room looking nice, but by using things that are affordable and built to last as much as possible!"
        },
        {
            "speaker": "Michelangelo",
            "message": "Wow, your balance between beauty and function is truly inspiring! You know, art always needs that bold courage to break conventions and reach perfection. So, in chasing this dream room, would you rather endure some hard challenges to achieve every detail just right, or would you choose an easier path with compromises to keep things simpler?",
            "response": "Well, I’m definitely the type who wants to go all in on the details wherever I can. So if it’s really about making the dream come true, I’d be ready to work super hard for it!"

I intended to focus on my artwork, yet the continuous noise made concentration quite elusive. I’m not being picky, but I did hope for a mutual respect for each other’s space and work. Perhaps my expectations were simply too high?",
            "response": "Oh, I’m really sorry about that… I totally get it, since I draw a lot too, and having a quiet space to focus is really important, right?"
        },

            "speaker": "Raffaello",
            "message": "Oh... I must also mention that it took me nearly an hour to clean up the so-called ‘creative garbage’ left in the common area afterward. I’m not being the least bit confrontational, but we did agree in the lease to maintain the quality of our shared home. Do you think such a standard is... reasonable for all of us to uphold?",
            "response": "Yeah, you’re right about the trash—if someone’s going to leave it for later, it’d be better to take it back to their own room and clean it up there. For now, let’s just wait for the next time. Nobody understands everything perfectly from the start, and people only change when things are gently said out loud, right?"

            "speaker": "Donatello",
            "message": "Logically speaking, we do need to balance our creative freedom with maintaining a comfortable living environment. Perhaps we could try setting a schedule with designated activity hours for creating and quieter hours for focus and rest. From your experience and perspective, what schedule do you think would be the most reasonable and effective solution for all of us to follow?",
            "response": "Since we both had things we wanted to do, it’s really just about finding the right balance. Maybe something simple, like keeping things quiet after 9 p.m., could work pretty well for everyone."

Since we’re all about balancing practicality and creativity here, if you could add just one cool thing to our dream room that would spark your art but still be super easy to take care of, what awesome element would you choose? Come on, share your creative spark!",
            "response": "How about a projector? Of course it could be used like a display, but with projection mapping we could instantly make the whole room look so much more vibrant and lively!"

            "message": "Oh... speaking of keeping our ShareHouse truly inspiring and harmonious, I was pondering—perhaps to better manage our shared spaces and fridge usage, would a weekly meeting to discuss chores and organization suit everyone, or might a shared online note be more considerate of our varying schedules? I'm not being picky, but balancing creative freedom with respectful tidiness seems essential, don't you think?",
            "response": "I think it’s really important to speak up before frustrations pile up, so I like the idea! Since some things are harder to explain just in writing, I’d prefer us actually meeting to talk. And for anyone who can’t make it, we could always keep the results in a shared online note—so everyone stays in the loop."

Do you think that would fuel our inspiration and help us reach those perfect artistic moments, or might it feel a bit too limiting for our free-flowing energy? I’m curious how such a rhythm could paint our daily lives here!",
            "response": "I really think having time to focus on something by yourself is super important—especially when it comes to artistic things! Since we can be so active during the day, I feel like evenings are already enough, and actually that rhythm might make everything go even more smoothly~"

            "response": "Yeah, I think I’m pretty good at pulling things together with a balanced perspective, so I could definitely do it! Plus, being the leader means you get to handle the coordination part, but also guide the project just a little toward your own style—so it actually feels like a nice win, too!"
