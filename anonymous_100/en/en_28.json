            "response": "I want to prepare for future, so I'll spent 30% for my trip, 50% for saving, and 20% for investment."

Tell me, is this dream fueled more by a deep emotional passion and your values, or do you have a clear, goal-oriented plan guiding you through every step of the journey? Art and life both need that spark of intention!",

I'm not being picky, but I wonder—do you think it’s important for all of us to consider balancing storage so fresh ingredients can also be accommodated? After all, we all deserve a living environment that nurtures well-being, don’t we?",

Wanna jump in and share your coolest ideas to make our ShareHouse the happiest place ever? Come on, friend, let’s dream big together! Haha!",

Now, let's analyze this: we need to consider how to make the best use of space, keep material costs manageable, and ensure maintenance is straightforward. When you think about the design, do you lean more towards practicality and function, or do you prioritize the aesthetic and creative look?",

I’m not being picky, but I did hope for a bit more mutual respect during such hours. Perhaps my expectations for considerate coexistence were too high... do you think that’s too much to ask in our shared space?",

I’m not being picky, but we did agree upon signing the lease to maintain the house’s quality and order. Do you think this standard we set for ourselves is... reasonable and fair to uphold for everyone's sake?",

Come on, don’t hold back your wildest dreams!",

I'm not being picky, but since many of us prefer saving for the future rather than planning every detail meticulously, do you have any particular tips for ensuring the thrill of discovery without compromising on financial prudence? I suppose balancing curiosity with practicality is an art in itself, don't you think?",
            "response": "Yes, I believe finding enjoyment within limited resources rather than consuming them endlessly, can be enjoyable in itself.
