            "response": "My dream is to invest everything in gambling and make even more money.\nIf it were me, I'd probably spend it on my hobbies like mountaineering and orienteering, or on books and computer equipment.\nThe rest I'd either invest or save.\n"

            "response": "If I were to gamble, I'd go all in, 100%. If not, I'd probably put about 40% each into investments and savings. Immediate expenses like my hobbies would be at most 20%, as I think it would only cost about 20 million yen."

I’m curious—does this all-in gambling passion come from a clear goal to hit a jackpot, or is it more about the thrill and emotion behind taking that risk? What’s the deeper motivation driving you to chase such an intense dream?",
            "response": "I want to gamble simply because I want to have fun. Having fun is the most important thing. I've never done it before, so I want to try it. Besides, it wasn't my own money to begin with."

I'm not being picky, but these packaged foods seem to consume much of the room that fresh, wholesome ingredients could occupy. Surely, we all hope to maintain a certain quality of life here, including in something as simple as our meals, don't we?",
            "response": "You should discuss once how to use the common space, including the refrigerator.\n"

How about we try rearranging the layout to make sure everyone has their fair share and fresh ingredients can shine? What kind of reorganization plan do you think would work best for all of us? Let’s brainstorm and make it awesome!",
            "response": "At first, each person should have their own cooking space, and people who cook often should discuss and adjust their spaces accordingly - eventually, this should work well.\n\n"

Donatello will dive into all the technical stuff to make sure our ideas can really work, and Michelangelo will splash in the artsy vibes to make it look stunning! Are you in, friend? What wild or wonderful ideas do you want to toss into our dream room design? Let’s get creative and make magic happen!",

            "speaker": "Donatello",
            "message": "Very interesting idea with the traditional Japanese wajyu-style room. From a practical standpoint, we need to carefully consider space utilization, the cost and availability of materials like tatami and shoji, and how easy it will be to maintain them over time. In designing this room, do you prioritize functional practicality or the authentic aesthetic design more?",
            "response": "Beauty may come first. It's not particularly functional-focused."

When creating this wajyu-style room, would you be willing to endure all the hardships and challenges to achieve absolute perfection, or would you consider an easier compromise to make things simpler? I’m super curious about your artistic spirit!",
            "response": "It seems like finding truly authentic Japanese-style rooms would be quite challenging.\nSo I think we'll just have to make do with what we have.\nBut when it comes to traditional Japanese furniture like difference shelves, I think we could probably make our own versions.\n"

I wanted to focus on finishing my own artwork, yet the continuous noise made concentration rather elusive. I'm not being picky, but I had hoped for a bit more mutual respect among us artists here. Perhaps my expectations were too high?",
            "response": "Indeed, creating quiet time is important.\nI think we should all share times when we should be quiet.\n"

I'm not being overly critical, but we did agree in the lease to maintain the quality of our home. Do you think this approach to cleanliness aligns with that understanding... or might there be room for improvement in how we care for our shared environment?",
            "response": "This problem can be addressed by enforcing the principle that those who use shared spaces must clean up after themselves."

How would that mix of old and new make you feel about our ShareHouse? Would it inspire you or make you want to hang out there more? Share your awesome thoughts!",

Imagine how peaceful our ShareHouse will feel with that calm nighttime vibe and sparkling clean spaces! Let’s make this a cozy, chill zone everyone loves to come home to! What else do you think would make our ShareHouse even more awesome? Share your cool ideas, friend! Haha!",

I'm not being picky, but such a thoughtful gathering could help maintain the elegance and order we all appreciate. Would this be something you find agreeable, do you think?",

Speaking of sharing and celebrating what we love, imagine if we could bring a burst of traditional Japanese culture right here into our ShareHouse—what kind of immersive, creative experience or fun activity would you propose to truly share the spirit and beauty of that culture with everyone? Would it be something hands-on, like a tea ceremony or calligraphy workshop, or perhaps a vibrant storytelling session that captures the heart and history? I’d love to hear your vision—art is all about sharing passion and connection, after all!",
