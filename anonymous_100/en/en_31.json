            "response": "I’d probably go with 20% for investments, 50% for daily living expenses, and 30% for savings."

I’m curious—does this adventure of living with friends and managing your money come from a clear, goal-driven plan, or is it more about following what feels right in your heart and values? What’s the true motivation lighting your way?",
            "response": "I think it’s more about following my values than having a clear goal. As long as I’m a student who can still rely on my parents, I want to spend as much time and money as possible on things and experiences that I can only do during my university years."

I’m not being picky, but perhaps we all wish to preserve an environment that supports fresh and wholesome ingredients alongside convenience. Do you think there might be a way we can balance this better for the sake of everyone’s quality of life here?",

How about we shuffle the layout a bit to make room for both packaged goodies and fresh treasures? What’s your dream fridge reorganization plan? Let’s hear your awesome ideas!",
            "response": "Hmm… Since it’s a share house, I think the best way is to assign each person their own space in the fridge, and let them decide how to use it freely."

Donatello will dive into the technical stuff to see what’s possible, and Michelangelo will bring the artistic magic to make it look amazing! Will you jump in with us? What wild, awesome ideas do you have to make our dream rooms truly unforgettable? Come on, friend, let’s imagine big together! Haha!",

Now, from a technical perspective, we need to carefully consider space utilization, the materials involved, and how easy it will be to maintain these AI features. In designing your dream room, do you lean more toward practical functionality or aesthetic design?",

In creating something perfect, would you choose to endure all the hardships and challenges to reach that ideal masterpiece, or would you be open to an easier compromise that’s more practical but less perfect? What’s your artistic spirit telling you?",
            "response": "I’d probably sacrifice a bit of perfection. I think aiming for absolute perfection can sometimes lead to lower-quality results and would take too much time."

I had intended to focus on finishing my artwork, but the persistent noise made concentration rather impossible. I’m not being picky, but I did hope for a bit more mutual respect in shared spaces—perhaps my expectations were too high? Do you think it’s too much to ask for a quieter environment during such times?",
            "response": "Excessive noise is definitely a problem, but since it’s a shared space in a share house, I think we have to accept a certain level of noise."

I’m not being picky, but we did agree in the lease to uphold a certain standard of cleanliness and quality in this house, did we not? I wonder... do you believe this is in keeping with our mutual understanding?",
            "response": "So someone who didn’t make the mess ended up cleaning it? If that’s the case, I’d say that’s unfair. But if the person who made the mess cleaned it up in the end, then they handled it responsibly and I think that shows understanding."

Perhaps establishing a schedule with designated activity times for creative work and quiet hours for rest could help. From your perspective, what would be the most reasonable way to structure such a schedule so that both noise and cleanliness concerns are addressed fairly?",
            "response": "Since everyone probably has their own preferences, I think it’s best to first have a discussion and hear everyone’s hopes. After that, we can create a final schedule that remains flexible."

Mountains, beach, a city adventure? And what cool activities would you want us to do to make it unforgettable? Come on, share your boldest dream for a fun escape!",

I’m not being overly particular, but balancing joyful interaction with personal focus can be quite the delicate art, don’t you agree?",
            "response": "It’s a tough choice, but I’d lean more toward the lively side. When I want quiet, I can adjust by going to a café or using earplugs, but creating a lively atmosphere on my own is much harder."

How do you think that kind of personalized art for our senses would spark new energy in your day or even in how we all connect here? It’s like turning everyday life into a masterpiece!",
            "response": "I think it would help us relax and refresh, making it easier to come up with good ideas! Also, when we’re in a good mood, we tend to be kinder to others, which can deepen our connections and increase overall happiness!"

            "response": "First, I think it’s effective to assign duties, designate spaces, and set schedules. Then, as we put these into practice, it’s important to have a system where we can easily discuss things that aren’t working, and also to maintain flexibility so that the rules can be adjusted as needed."
